Delaze is a virtual reality app made to treat amblyopia (lazy eye) by encouraging binocular vision.

Using Google Cardboard, Delaze makes a previously expensive, unavailable to the public treatment available to the masses.

Lazy eye has historically been treated with an eyepatch on a child from ages 3-12. There were no treatments available to adults, and the eyepatch method often didn't work.

A few years ago, [research](http://mvr.mcgill.ca/Robert/clinicaltrial/clinicaltrial.html "clinical trial") began on treating lazy eye with Virtual Reality. These novel methods were amazingly effective - they worked on adults and worked much better on kids. One study said 10-60 hours of the Virtual Reality treatment was as good as or better than 200-400 hours of the eyepatch method.

This treatment is implemented with a Tetris-like game. Fallen block are in high contrast in one eye and in low contrast in the other, and the opposite contrast is given to the falling blocks. These two images combine when viewing in a Google Cardboard VR Headset, without you noticing which eye sees what blocks. This has the effect of making you use your lazy eye and dominant eye in conjunction, which over time treats the condition.

Delaze started at the MHacks IV Hackathon, with partners @raphaelrk (senior at Mundelein High School) and @qwuke (freshman at Wayne State) teaming up to make something worth making.
